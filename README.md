# Lab 01 - Hello GOALS in CS!

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate editing, running, and testing of GitHub Classroom lab

## Instructions
1. **Investigate the code**
  
Open [Main.java](./Main.java) and look at the code. There is a lot of extra code for a
simple program, but today just notice that we have a `class` named `Main`, a method 
named `main` and a statement `System.out.println("Hello world.);`.

2. **Run the code**

Running or executing your code will allow you to see how it currently works,

There are a number of ways to run a program in VS Code.
- You can use the Run and Debug tool in the Activity Bar.
- You can choose Run Java from the context menu in the program.
- You can select the play button on the top right of the editor window.
- You can choose Run Without Debugging from the Run menu.
   
The output will appear in the terminal window.

3. **Change the code**

**_To complete this lab_**, edit the code so it says:

```
Hello, GOALS in CS!
```

Note, it must say the above **exactly** as shown. 

4. **Test the code**

Built in tests can check your code to see if you have made the changes correctly. The way these tests are run depends on your IDE.
If your code passes the test, a green checkmark will appear. If you see a red X, click on the expected message and investigate the differences.

5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 until done**

6. **Commit and Push your code**

   1. Click on the Source Control icon (three interconnected circles).
   2. Click on the plus sign next to the files you wish to commit.
   3. Enter a meaningful commit message.
   4. Click the Commit & Push button.
